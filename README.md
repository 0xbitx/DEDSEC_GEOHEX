<h1 align="center">GEOHEX</h1> <h4 align="center">Geolocation intelligence for tracking, fingerprinting, and forensics.</h4>

## OVERVIEW

**GEOHEX** is an advanced, all-in-one intelligence-gathering platform designed specifically for cybersecurity experts, digital investigators who are committed to tracking down and exposing malicious actors online. The platform employs a clever social engineering tactic: investigators create a specially designed link that looks like a legitimate website or service. This link is then sent to targets during online interactions.

When a target clicks on the link, they are greeted by a convincing interface that presents enticing scenarios—like a "Security Checkpoint" or "Exclusive Content Access"—all aimed at tricking them into granting permissions for their camera and GPS location. Once these permissions are granted, GEOHEX kicks off a comprehensive intelligence collection routine in real-time, working quietly in the background. This process gathers a complete forensic profile, including accurate geolocation data with detailed address breakdowns, device fingerprints, and automated camera captures—all neatly organized into an easy-to-use dashboard for quick analysis and evidence gathering.

The platform goes beyond simple data logging, providing dynamic tracking and rich contextual insights. It doesn’t just identify where a target is; it breaks down their surroundings—whether they’re in a house, school, or commercial space—and can actively monitor their movements, calculating speed and direction to figure out if they’re walking or driving. All the collected data, from detailed device fingerprints to a collection of automatically captured front-camera images, is seamlessly organized into an intuitive dashboard. This includes an interactive world map for visual tracking and a centralized media gallery, allowing investigators to build strong evidence.

### PRIMARY USE CASES
  * Child Protection Operations: Track and identify predators engaging in illegal activities
  * Threat Intelligence: Monitor and analyze malicious actors' digital footprints
  * Security Research: Study attack patterns and threat behaviors

## KEY FEATURES
   * Social Engineering: Advanced URL masking mimics legitimate platforms to facilitate intelligence gathering.
   * Default URL Camouflage: Pre-configured to resemble trusted websites, increasing engagement from targets.
   * Advanced Geolocation Intelligence:
        * Precise GPS Data: Acquisition of the target's exact latitude and longitude coordinates.
        * Comprehensive Location Deconstruction: Goes beyond coordinates to provide detailed contextual data about the target's precise location, including:
            * OSM Reference: Direct link to the OpenStreetMap object for manual verification and deeper analysis.
            * Full Address: A complete, formatted address for immediate use.
            * Structural Details: House number, street name, and suburb.
            * Administrative Areas: City, region, and postcode.
            * Point-of-Interest (POI) Type: Critical context classifying the location as a house, commercial building, school, cemetery, etc., which is vital for assessing threat level and operational planning.
        * Movement Detection & Tracking: The tool can detect and analyze target movement by calculating the distance and time between location points (Point A to Point B). This provides actionable intelligence on the target's activity, showing if they are walking, running, or in a vehicle, including metrics for speed, duration, and distance traveled.

   * Target Media Gallery: A window for all front-facing camera snapshots collected from a target. This allows for easy review, and analysis of all visual evidence associated with a specific individual.
   * IP Intelligence: Complete network and connection information, including ISP, ASN, and approximate location.
   * Device Fingerprinting: Comprehensive hardware and software profiling (OS, browser, screen resolution, device type, ISP etc.).
   * Automated Camera Capture: Takes 10 or infinite snapshots upon target camera access.
   * Interactive World Map: Visual geolocation tracking interface for situational awareness.
   * Real-Time Data Visualization: Easy-to-understand dashboard for all collected intelligence.
